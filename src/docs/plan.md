# Plan

## Game Overview

-Inspired by pokerogue
-It's like an infinite RPG roguelite game and is text-based. The player can either move or buy from the shop 3 move are all enemies
the fourth one would be 3 random items to choose from and the 5th would be a boss battle.

## Gameplay

-Game starts with a menu that asks for the player's class then name
-The game starts and the player is asked 3 question MOVE, SHOP or QUIT
-During battles, the player may choose any attack (Max 4) but they should progress on getting it like pokemon moves. 
-It is also turn base so the enemies get to move next
